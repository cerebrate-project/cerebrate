The Cerebrate Sync Platform core software

Cerebrate is an open-source platform meant to act as a trusted contact information provider and interconnection orchestrator for other security tools.

It is currently being built under the Melicertes v2 project and is heavily work in progress.

Currently it maintains a repository of organisations and individuals along with signing keys and their affiliations.

The platform is built on CakePHP 4 along with Bootstrap 4 and shares parts of the code-base with MISP.
